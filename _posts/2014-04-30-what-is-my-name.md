I know it is very hard for people do not speak Chinese to spell my name. Here is a list of what I was called in emails:

+ Daijaing: 46 threads of emails
+ Daijing: 30 threads of emails
+ Diajiang: 27 threads of emails
+ Daijian: 11 threads of emails
+ Dajiang: 3 thread of emails
+ Diajing: 2 threads of emails

Here is the plot:

I did not include my correct name, which is *Daijiang* because all of emails with my name in the signature and I do not know how to filter it from the search...
