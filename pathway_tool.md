# Installation

## Decisions:
1.  creation and editing of PGDBs can be performed through desktop mode only. Therefore I want the __desktop version__.

2. If you plan to create new PGDBs, you can store them in either files, or in a relational database management system (RDBMS). __File-based__ PGDBs are easier to set up; they do not require installation or configuration of an RDBMS. OK maybe later.

3. Firmicutes is under Terrabacteria group
